## About Me

I'm a software engineer currently working as an IT Coordinator, where I get to blend hands-on tech work with a strategic IT management.  
My journey spans from web development (PHP, JavaScript) to system programming and scripting (Rust, Bash, Python).  
These days, I'm exploring the wonders of functional programming with Haskell and Erlang—just dipping my toes in!

- 🖥️ **Tech Stack:** Linux, Docker, Bash, Rust, Python, PHP, JavaScript
- 🗄️ **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- 🛠️ **Server Stuff:** Configuration, orchestration, and all things backend

## Favorite Projects & Inspirations

- My GitHub is home to projects from ASCII webcams ([ascii-webcam](https://github.com/nubilfi/ascii-webcam)) and more.
- I deeply admire tools like **ffmpeg** for their versatility and power.
- Always tinkering, always learning!
